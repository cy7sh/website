Couple days ago I stared using fediverse. I had an account on fosstodon.org some time ago but never used it. I followed some people and all of them seem to have pretty websites and I wanted one too. Luckily, I was able to get a free .me domain from Namecheap using my student email address. I fought with hugo all day today, and here is what I have. I used the [archie](https://github.com/athul/archie) theme and made some modifications to it. I think it looks good. I wish I was a better writer, but I know I'll get there.
