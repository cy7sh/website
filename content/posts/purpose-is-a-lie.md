I have been reading the [unabomber
manifesto](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm)
and it is one of the best things I have ever read. I have understood a lot
about our society from reading it and something important about purpose which
is what this post is about. Whether it's hacking or programming, the greatest
issue for me is about getting started on a new project. I lack a sense
of purpose. I look around I see a lot of people that build stuff that are
tremendously useful to a LOT of people. Lots of github stars, lots of users,
pretty popular stuff. They must have a good feeling of purposefulness right?
They seem pretty passionate about building useful stuff and making people's
lives better. I see the big tech comapnies trying very hard to build the right
thing. Their employees talking about how good they feel working for them and
building the product that helps so many people. I see people that build
electric cars to save the environment, rockets to get to mars and save humanity,
build AI to detect cancer and shit. People much smarter than me
doing stuff with a purpose. And there's me kinda smart but I have no idea what
the fuck I should even do. No, wait. What fuck I should do that isn't boring. I
know I should read that book about the mental illness I suspect myself to have,
but that's boring as fuck. Tremendously helpful and healthy, but boring as
fuck. I don't want to be normal. I think I can have enough fun as I am.

I remember a [blog post](https://blog.comma.ai/a-100x-investment-part-2/) by
George Hotz.

The part about stories and making products inspirational. Advertising is
about using psychological tricks to intice people to buy things. Maybe
the advertisers lie that the company is fighting for a greater purpose
for PR? I have tried to do things with a purpose. It's very easy to get
started, but impossible to continue. It never lasts. The things that
last have no purpose and thus are diffcult to get started on, but
impossible to resist once on it. Buying a product is extremenly
frictionless. Clck a button and it's on your door. It doesn't have to
last. People want to do things that have good purpose cause that makes
them good people. Society says that good is good. A company that follows
a good purpose is a good company. It's a psychological trick to make
people buy stuff and further fuel the idea of purpose. People who want
to build stuff are ashamed that they are incapable of working towards a
purpose, but the truth is no one is.

Smart people don't do things for a purpose, they do it for fulfillment.
It's about the process not the output.

It's the people who do things for fun that get to the top. Those that
don't care about the fake notions like purpose that society establishes
and just do what they feel like. Hacking is not about
[usefulness](https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html).
